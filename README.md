 Case Description

Bloomberg terminals are a powerful tool in the hands of financial professionals.
But the data downloaded from there requires significant polishing and formatting before it can be presented to decision-makers.
In this Analysis and Visualization of P&L Data in Excel project, youâ€™re an analyst who downloaded Bloomberg data and is asked to prepare a concise report and visualizations.
To perform this task well, you must use advanced Excel lookup functions, apply professional formatting, and create appealing charts
to help management understand financial performance at first glance,
which is challenging to do with this data. But these are the type of tasks a well-prepared analyst needs to be able to perform on the job.

I add dataset and of course solution files. You can check yourself also.
I added waterfall graph for 2023 year. It representes our profit loss table visually.
